# Aggregation and Visualization of Data for Disease Outbreak Surveillance

## Introduction
In the modern world, health informatics is a rapidly emerging field in medical sciences. Traditional treatment methods for many diseases are complex, time-consuming, and often unaffordable for large portions of the global population. Health informatics offers the potential to improve treatment efficiency, making healthcare quicker, more convenient, and more affordable.

## Significance
Health informatics, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), can save billions of dollars annually by improving diagnostic accuracy, interoperability, and disease outcome predictions. Tools like **Synthea** and **Google Looker Studio** help in reducing disease spread and healthcare costs by making healthcare delivery more efficient.

## Problem to Be Solved
Using health informatics technologies such as **Synthea** and **Google Looker Studio**, this project identifies the regions most affected by COVID-19. Early precautionary treatment based on this data helps reduce disease spread, healthcare costs, hospital workload, and patient waiting times. Technologies like remote patient monitoring and telemedicine further enhance efficient, affordable treatment.

## Specialization
I am a health informatics and medical professional with expertise in:
- Electronic Health Records (EHR) & Electronic Medical Records (EMR)
- Python, MySQL, Linux/Ubuntu
- Pharmacology, Ophthalmology, Molecular Biology, and Animal Studies

This unique combination of clinical background and informatics knowledge enables me to predict disease progression and improve patient outcomes significantly.

## Personal Contribution
As a clinician (Optometrist & Pharmacologist), I applied health informatics technologies to advise physicians on early intervention strategies for COVID-19. This work supports investigations into different COVID-19 mutations and enhances disease surveillance capabilities.

# Project Components

## 1. Python Script
- A completed Python script is provided to aggregate data from the Synthea dataset and generate insights.
- Significant comments have been added within the script to explain complex processes and data points.
- The original provided code was not functioning properly; a new script was created, including conversion from JSON to Python code.
- Challenges included handling a large dataset (approximately 9GB, 1481 patients) causing frequent system hangs.
- After downloading the dataset from VM software and multiple code modifications, the script was successfully run.

## 2. Insights from Results
Two key insights obtained from the script:
- **Identifying COVID-19 cases** in relevant cities.
- **Analyzing outbreak severity** (high or low infection rates) in those cities.

## 3. Google Looker Studio Visualization
- A dashboard was created and publicly shared on Google Looker Studio.
- **Dashboard Link:** [COVID-19 Monitored Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/pQ_eoC8BB9U)
- **Visualizations Included:**
  - **Plot Map:** Displays COVID-19 cases geographically, highlighting areas with varying infection rates.
  - **Bar Chart:** Compares the number of COVID-19 cases per city.
- **Dashboard Refresh Interval:** Set to refresh automatically every 12 hours (minimum possible interval).

Screenshots have been attached for MGH region mapping and city-wise bar charts.

# Conclusion
By combining health informatics technologies with clinical expertise, this project provides an efficient and effective approach to monitoring and controlling disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Data-driven insights and visualizations not only support early intervention but also contribute to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care quality.
